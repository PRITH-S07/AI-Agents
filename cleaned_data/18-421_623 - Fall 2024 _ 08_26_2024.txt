Course Description:  
Some form of analog circuit design is a critical step in the creation of every modern IC. 
First and foremost, analog circuits act as the interface between digital systems and the real 
world. They act to amplify and filter analog signals and convert signals from analog to 
digital and back again. In addition, high-performance digital cell design (either high speed 
or low power) also invokes significant analog circuit design issues. The goal of this course 
is to teach students some of the methods used in the design and analysis of analog integrated 
circuits, to illustrate how one approaches design problems in general, and to expose 
students to a broad cross-section of important analog circuit topologies. The course will 
focus on learning design through carrying out design projects. Design and implementation 
details of wide-band amplifiers, operational amplifiers, filters, and basic data converters 
will be covered. Example topics to be covered include transistor large- and small-signal 
device models, small-signal characteristics of transistor-based amplifiers, large-signal 
amplifier characteristics and non-idealities, operational amplifier design, basic feedback 
amplifier stability analysis and compensation, and comparator design. The course will 
focus primarily on analog CMOS, but some aspects of BJT devices will be discussed.

Grading Algorithm:  
 
Two methods will be used to compute a score for each student in the course. Each method has a 
maximum possible value of 100:  
  
Homework (8)  10%  
Design Projects (3)  15% 1+ 15%  + 15%= 45%  
Exams (2)   20% + 20% = 40%  
Notebook (1)   5%  
The following maximum grade cutoffs are guaranteed:  
 > 92 A  

 
3 
 
 > 83 B  
 > 72 C  
 > 61 D  
NOTE: Although students in 18-623 will share Lectures with students in 18-421, students in 18-
623 will receive distinct homework assignments, distinct design problems, and distinct exams from 
the ones given to students in 18-421 and will be graded separately from students taking 18-421.
