Course Description:  
 
Embedded real-time systems pervade many aspects of modern life ranging from 
household appliances, transportation and motion control systems, medical systems, 
robotics, multimedia and mobile communications, video-games, energy 
generation/distribution/management, to aerospace and defense systems.  
This course has three complementary goals. First, it will cover the core concepts and 
principles underlying these systems, including resource management, scheduling, 
dependability and safety. Implications to multi-core platforms, SoCs, networks and 
communication buses will also be discussed. Mathematical models and analysis 
techniques will be presented. Secondly, the course will offer hands-on experience with 
implementing embedded real-time systems on realistic platforms. This will be facilitated 
by detailed discussions of hardware-software interfaces, concurrency and 
communications. Finally, application-level concepts such as signal processing, image 
processing, computer vision, sensor fusion and feedback control will complete an 
overview of the breadth and depth of embedded real-time systems. Knowledge of the C 
programming language, basic computer architecture and an assembly language will be 
assumed.

Brief List of Topics Covered: 
Students should expect to learn how to program with the embedded architecture that is 
ubiquitous in portable gaming devices, robots, tablets, cell-phones, etc. Students will then 
go on to learn and apply real-time principles that are used to drive critical embedded 
systems like automobiles, avionics, medical equipment and planetary rovers. Topics 
covered include embedded architectures (building up to modern 16/32/64-bit embedded 
processors); interaction with devices (buses, memory architectures, memory 
management, device drivers); concurrency (software and hardware interrupts, timers); 
principles of resource management for predictable timing (multi-tasking, scheduling, 
synchronization); implementation trade-offs, profiling and code optimization (for 
performance and memory); embedded software (exception handling, loading, mode-
switching, programming embedded systems). Through a series of laboratory exercises 
with embedded processors and popular development tools, students will acquire skills in 
the design/implementation/debugging of core embedded real-time functionality.

Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes) 
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your 
education.  ABET defines 7 Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of 

 
4 
 
all the courses you take.  The following list describes which objectives are fulfilled by 
this course and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives are numbered from “1” 
through “7” in the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by this course 
have been omitted from the following list: 
 
1. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by 
applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. 
3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences. 
4. an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering 
situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of 
engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. 
5. an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide 
leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan 
tasks, and meet objectives. 
6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and 
interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
