Course Description:  
 
Amateur radio is a pursuit that encompasses equal parts technology, communication, and 
public safety. It began in the US with the Radio Act of 1912, which guaranteed use of the 
electromagnetic spectrum to the people, provided they demonstrated the requisite technical 
competence. These privileges have persisted to the present day, with a vibrant global 
community of radio amateurs (hams) utilizing the spectrum to tinker and experiment with 
wireless communications for satellites, drone control, low-power communication, radio 
astronomy, and so on! 
 
This course will introduce students to the history, art, and science of radio with emphasis on 
hands-on demonstrations and in-class projects, including soldering a low-power FM 
transmitter and building a directional antenna. Students will also self-study to pass an 
amateur radio licensing exam administered on campus, which unlocks the electromagnetic 
spectrum for personal, non-commercial use. Radio service for public safety is tightly woven 
into the cultural fabric of the Buggy tradition at Carnegie Mellon. Becoming licensed is the 
first step to getting involved! Anyone interested in becoming a licensed amateur radio user 
is welcome regardless of major or prior background! 
 
Topics covered include: 
• Radio signal fundamentals 
• Basic electronics 
• Antennas 
• Radio wave propagation 
• Radio equipment

Grading and Assignments: 
This course is letter-graded. Each assignment is worth a certain number of points. Note that

most interesting way for you to engage with the class. Other assignment options may be 
announced later in the semester.

Get Licensed or Upgrade License (5-7 points): 
The Technician class is the entry-level license for amateur radio in the US. In order 
to become licensed, a prospective ham must answer at least 26 out of 35 questions 
on a multiple-choice test administered by an FCC-sanctioned group of Volunteer 
Examiners. 
 
An additional point is awarded for every additional license class you earn. For 
example, an unlicensed student who successfully passes the Technician, General, 
and Extra exams will receive 7 points. See the following table for all possible 
combinations:

We will have a test session on campus March 19 for your convenience, but you may 
take an exam elsewhere to fulfill this requirement. 
 
FM Transmitter Build (1 point) 
An FM transmitter kit will be distributed in class. This is to be soldered on your own 
time, although we will have a soldering instructional workshop. This transmitter 
should take about 2 hours of work to complete, and must be completed by April 23 
for credit. Demonstrate your transmitter after class one week, or schedule a time to 
visit the instructor’s office hours. 
 
Antenna Build (1 point) 
On March 26, the class will build and test wire dipole antennas. Working in a group 
that assembles and tests one of these antennas will earn the participation point. 
 
Shack Night Visit (1 point): 
The W3VC Carnegie Tech Radio Club meets weekly for Shack Nights. Stop by the 
amateur radio club station in 4101 Hamerschlag Hall during a weekly Shack Night, 
stay for 30 minutes or so, and write up your experience into a summary and submit 
on Canvas. 
 
Please include the following information in your summary: 
• 
What were people working on? 
• 
What sort of equipment/radios did you see? 
• 
Did anybody make any on-air contacts?

Field Day QSO (1 point): 
Field Day will occur on Flagstaff Hill during class time on either April 16 or April 
23 (depending on weather). Several radios will be set up with the opportunity to 
make a QSO (on air contact). Submit a summary of your contact on Canvas if you 
participate in Field Day. 
Please include the following information in your summary: 
• 
What was the other amateur's callsign? 
• 
What frequency and mode were used? 
• 
Was a signal report exchanged? What RST did you send, and what did you 
receive? 
• 
Anything else of note about the QSO? 
 
Scotty Net Check-in (1 point): 
In ham radio parlance, a net is a scheduled on-air meeting of amateur radio 
operators. Once everybody gets their licenses, we will hand out radios and hold a 
weekly net (time TBD). If you check in to one of these nets, you will complete the 
assignment. The last Scotty Net for the semester is on April 30. 
 
Scotty Net Control (1 point): 
“Net Control” is the amateur who manages the flow of signals on a net. Serving as 
Net Control for one week and submitting the list of check-ins afterwards will earn 
the point. Depending on demand, two net controllers might co-manage the net each 
week. 
 
Reflection (1 point): 
This is a written reflection, ~500 words, that describes your experience with the 
course, due on April 30. Feel free to write about anything you like; here are some 
questions that might get you started: 
• What do you think of amateur radio having finished the course? 
• Did you learn anything surprising? 
• What do you think you will do with your license? 
• What was your favorite hands-on demo or project in the class? 
 
 
Buggy Net (4 points): 
The Buggy Safety Net is a long-running tradition at CMU. Participate in the ham 
radio club’s buggy safety net one time during weekend rolls or carnival for credit. 
Submit a report on Canvas afterwards describing your experience. 
• What date and times did you participate? 
• What was your role in the net? 
• What did you observe about the structure of the net/radio transmissions? 
• Did anything interesting happen on the course, and how did the net respond?
