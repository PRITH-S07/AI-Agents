Class Schedule:  
The teaching of this course uses lectures, recitations, piazza, and office hours: 
 
Lecture: 
 
Tuesday and Thursday 
12:30pm-1:50pm  
POS 153 
 
Recitations: 
Section A: Friday, 9:00 -9:50am,  
DH 1117 
 
Section B: Friday, 10:00am-10:50am, BH 255A 
Section C: Friday, 11:00am-11:50am, POS 147 
Section D: Friday, 12:00pm-12:50pm, BH 235A 
 
The assignment of students to recitations is initially done by the Registrar. We may 
reassign students for better balance of the recitations. 
 
Lectures focus on the high level with few problems solved. Emphasis on concepts, 
theorems, and sketches of proofs. Students should attend the lectures since they are 
integral part of the learning process. Students are encouraged to interrupt with questions 
at any point of the lecture, even if only to slow down the lecture. 
 
Recitations emphasize working examples that illustrate the concepts presented in the 
lecture. Recitations are not lectures, they should be interactive. The students are asked 
to attempt or help working the solutions to problems presented. Like for lectures, 
students should attend the recitations since they are integral part of the learning process. 
 
Office hours are designed for students to raise any issues and questions they have with 
homework problems and any other course topic and then work through these issues with 
the help of the teaching staff. Besides the office hours listed above, students can send an 
email or approach a member of the staff and request a meeting at a mutually convenient 
time. 
 
Piazza (integrated into the Canvas ) Prior experience shows that Piazza is a very effective 
way to address timely and effectively students’ questions. Students are encouraged to 
check frequently Piazza.

Course Description:  

 
3 
 
Number of Units: 12 
Undergraduate Course Area: ECE Mathematics 
 
Textbook and Readings:  
• Lecture notes are available on Canvas 
 
The following are published textbooks that cover or complement relevant course 
material: 
• Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 4th Edition, Gilbert Strang 
• Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra – Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares 
Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe 
 
Brief Contents: 
The course covers topics from engineering mathematics that serve as foundations for 
description, analysis, and synthesis of engineered systems and signals. This is an applied 
mathematics course. We will mix rigor with motivation and intuition. After a brief review 
of complex numbers and differential equations, the course focus on Linear Algebra and 
Its Applications. 
 
See the course calendar (at the end of this document) for a tentative schedule.  
 
Grading Algorithm:  
Homework  
 
25% 
(around 10 or 11 homeworks, worst one will be dropped) 
Exams           
 
70% 
(3 exams (2 midterms + final): 20%+20%+30%) 
Lecture attendance 
10% 
(Lecture contributes an additional 5% bonus) 
 
The final grade is a letter grade A, B, C, D or Fail (R). The numerical scores are converted 
into a letter grade according to the following: 
 
Grade = A if numerical score greater than or equal to 90 % 
Grade = B if numerical score greater than or equal to 80 % 
Grade = C if numerical score greater than or equal to 70 % 
Grade = D if numerical score greater than or equal to 50 % 
Grade = R if numerical score smaller than 50 % 
 
In exceptional cases, students whose numerical score falls at slightly below one of the 
above thresholds may end-up with a higher letter grade if the staff strongly advocates 
that the student’s understanding of the course material should correspond to a higher 
letter grade. Additionally, based on relative class performance, the above thresholds may 
be slightly adjusted. 
 
Students can submit regrading requests for homeworks within one week of grades being 
released. For exams, regrade request must be made within three days after the grades 

 
4 
 
are released. If materials are submitted for re-grading, the entire piece of work is subject 
to re-grade (not just the part requested by the student). 
 
Lectures: 
Lecture attendance will be noted – students will enter an arbitrary code provided during 
lecture into a web link. Attendance of a lecture contributes roughly .45 points. Students 
can miss up to 3 Lectures with no penalty. There are 27 lecture days, two of which are 
used for midterms. If students attend 22 of the remaining 25 Lectures they get 10 
additional points. These with the 25 points of the homeworks and 70 points of the three 
exams add to 105 points, corresponding to 5 extra points added to the numerical score 
of a student. 
Recitations: 
Recitations will include in-class discussion. Specifically, homework questions and exam 
preparation are effectively addressed as a group during recitations. 
 
Homeworks:  
Expect about 10 or 11 homeworks, roughly, one per week. Homework assignments will 
be posted and submitted via gradescope. Completed homeworks are due at the 11:59pm 
of the due date indicated on the Homework. Late homeworks will absolutely not be 
accepted once the solutions are made available. 
 
Students are encouraged to study together. However, problem sets should correspond to 
the individual work of each student. It is okay to discuss problems with colleagues and 
teaching staff. It is NOT okay to hand in a homework that does not reflect your 
understanding of the problems, or a homework that copies someone else’ solution.  
 
Late days: Students have up to five late days for homeworks over the course. No more 
than two late days can be used per homework. No late day can be used for the last 
homework (possibly, homework 10 or 11). Late days are applied automatically based on 
Gradescope upload time stamps, interpreted in Eastern Time (EST or EDT). Students are 
responsible for tracking their late days, as instructors will not send reminders. Late days 
are used up in increments of full days, i.e., one hour late means a late day was used up. 
No extensions will be given beyond these late days. However, should you experience a 
true emergency, please reach out to us and we will address the impact on a case-by-case 
basis with your academic advisor. Please also reach out to us if you have a special 
accommodation from Disability Resources.

Exams:  
There are two exams given throughout the semester, scheduled during lecture time slots 
and a final exam scheduled by the registrar: 
 
Exam 1: February 11, Tuesday 12:30pm-1:50pm 
 
Exam 2: March 25, Tuesday 12:30pm-1:50pm 
 
Exam 3: To be scheduled by the Registrar, during the finals week 
Exams are cumulative and closed book. Students are allowed (also cumulatively) one new 
sheet (double sided) of notes per exam. For example, one sheet for Exam 1, two sheets 
for Exam 2, and three sheets for Exam 3.

Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes) 
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your 
education.  ABET defines 7 Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of 
all the courses you take.  The following list describes which objectives are fulfilled by 
this course and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives are numbered from “1” 
through “7” in the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by this course 
have been omitted from the following list: 
 
1. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by 
applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics 
2. an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified 
needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, 
cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors 
3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences 
4. an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering 
situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of 
engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts 
5. an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide 
leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan 
tasks, and meet objectives 
6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and 
interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions 
7. an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate 
learning strategies.
