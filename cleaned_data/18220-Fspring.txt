100% 
 
Students will be assigned the following final letter grades, based on 
calculations coming from the course assessment section: 
 
90 – 100 
A 
80 – 89.9 
B 
70 – 79.9 
C 
60 – 69.9 
D 
00 – 59.9 
R / F 
 
Note, 18-220 has a policy of not curving the grades or rounding up.  For 
example, if you get an 89.999 over the entire semester, you will receive a 
grade of “B” for the semester.   Please allow us to repeat that.     
   
FOR EXAMPLE, WITH A GRADE OF 89.999, YOU WILL RECEIVE 
A GRADE OF “B.”

Homework: 
Homework will account for 10% of your semester grade.  We typically have 
12 or 13 homework assignments per semester.  However, only your 10 best 
scores are included in the calculation of your grade.  Homework will be 
assigned every MONDAY and will be due the following MONDAY, via 
Gradescope, at 5PM, Pittsburgh time. No late homework will be accepted.  
Please allow us to repeat that:  
 
 
NO LATE HOMEWORK WILL BE ACCEPTED.   
 
 
It is YOUR responsibility to ensure your homework is submitted on time, 
every time.  Don’t just upload your file and forget about it.  Double-check to 
make sure you uploaded the correct file.  In addition, you may consider 
uploading a “safety” or “back-up” version of your homework while you are 
working your way through the assignment.  Only your last submission will 
be graded. 
 
 
Solutions to the homework will be provided on Canvas shortly after it is due.  
  
Discussions about homework amongst students are encouraged.  However, 
  
homework must be written up individually and independently. Questions 
regarding homework will be covered during class times, as well as office 
hours. 
 
 
Please review your homework scores when you receive them. You have one 
week after a graded item is returned to request a grade correction.  All 
homework corrections must be submitted via Gradescope.   
 
 
Exams: 
Exams will account for 60% of your semester grade.   
 
 
Two midterms are each worth 20% of the course grade, and a final exam is 
worth 40%.   
 
 
You may either drop ONE MID-TERM EXAM   or   WEIGHT YOUR 
FINAL EXAM GRADE BY HALF.   
 
• 
If you drop one midterm exam grade, then your exam score will be 
composed of the other midterm (20%) and the final exam (40%).   
 
For example, consider that your two exam scores were 65% and 85%.  
Your final exam score was 75%.  Then, your 65% midterm would 
automatically be dropped, and your final exam score of 75% would 
receive its full weighting. 
 
• 
If you drop half the final exam weighting, then your total exam score will 
be composed of the two midterms (20% each) and the final exam (20%). 
 
For example, consider that your two exam scores were 65% and 85%.  
Your final exam score was 55%.  Then, your 55% final exam score 
weighting would be reduced to 20%.  Your total exam score would be 
composed of your two midterms (20% each) and the 55% on the final 
exam (20%).

Labs: 
Lab assignments will be distributed on Canvas and collected at the end of 
your lab session.  Labs must be done in groups of 2 students (or in rare cases, 
3 students), but all students must participate.  
 
 
You may not drop any labs.  If you are unable to complete a lab during your 
normal session, you will have the opportunity to work on the lab at an 
alternate time.   
 
 
You and your partner must be able to make it to the entire lab time.  One 
partner may not do the first half and the second partner due the second half. 
 
 
If you are unable to complete a lab during your normal session, they typically 
must be turned in by 7pm on your next lab night.  For example, if you are 
in lab section A, your first lab starts at 7pm on Tuesday, 14-Jan.  You must 
complete the lab, have it checked off, and turned in before 7pm on Tuesday, 
21-Jan. 
 
 
Recitation 
When you registered for 18-220, you also registered for a small group, with 
Small Groups: 
all the small groups meeting on Fridays.  In small groups, students will work  
with a pair of teaching assistants to review the week’s lecture material, 
discuss the pending homework assignment, and prepare for the next week’s 
lab.  Approximately 20% of each week's lab grade will be based on 
participation in lab-oriented exercises in the small group.  As such, a 
significant amount of your learning is expected to occur during the small 
group sessions, and attendance is mandatory. 
 
Each student will have two (2) “sick days” during the semester that they may 
use if they are not able to attend their small groups.  However, to use one of 
your sick days, you must send an email to your TAs (copying your 
professors) BEFORE THE START OF YOUR SMALL GROUP.  (Yup, 
that’s how sick days work in the “real world.”)  Failure to notify your TAs 
and professors before the start of your small group will result in an 
unexcused absence which may negatively impact your course grade. 
 
To use a sick day, use an email subject of:  SICK DAY 
 
Include in the email your section and start time:

Wireless Policies: 
To minimize distractions and show your teammates respect, cell phones 
should normally be turned off while you are in the classroom.  If you believe 
you have a valid excuse to leave your cell phone on, please let me know.

Student Wellness: 
As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere 
with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, 
feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These 
mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic 
performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities.  
 
 
CMU services are available, and treatment does work.  
 
 
You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on 
campus at: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/

If you already have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources 
office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with your 
faculty as early in the semester as possible. We will work with you to ensure 
that accommodations are provided as appropriate. 
 
 
Approximately 20% of all college students self-report having a disability.  
This an issue that we take very personally.  We want to provide every student 
with the opportunity to thrive and succeed.  That may look different for each 
student.  Please let us know how we can help.

Education Objectives 
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your  
and Relationship to 
education. ABET defines 7 Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the  
Program Outcomes: 
sum total of all the courses you take.  The following list describes which 
objectives are fulfilled and how they are fulfilled by 18-220. The objectives 
are numbered from “1” through “7” in the standard ABET parlance.  
 
(1) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering 
problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and 
mathematics: Design of circuits, including RLC and op amp filters, that 
require application of mathematical and physical concepts and an 
understanding of engineering design concepts. Open ended circuit design 
problems that represent real-world engineering problems such as wireless 
and IR remote signal propagation, investigation of faults in transmission 
lines using time domain reflectometry, and design of RFID tags and 
scanner/reader.  
 
(2)  an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet 
specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, 
as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors: 
Design of op amp circuits that recognize the importance of feedback for 
providing a controlled gain in spite of manufacturing variations for the 
semiconductors. The use of low-power and energy harvesting design 
techniques for future electronic systems.  
  
(3)  an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences: 
Student lab notebooks capture circuit designs, measurement results and lab 
experience in a form communicating all details to the lab/course instructors. 
  
(4)  an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in 
engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must 
consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, 
environmental, and societal contexts: The impact of wireless technology, 
RFID, etc., on the global community is discussed throughout the semester. 
 
(5)  an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together 
provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, 
establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives: Lab work is conducted in 
teams and requires close collaboration to complete a challenging lab in a 
short time period.  
 
(6)  an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, 
analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw 
conclusions: Lab designs and supporting experiments that range from 
circuits convert energy from other domains to tuning circuits for use in 
wireless radio transceivers. 
 
(7)  an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using 
appropriate learning strategies: Lecture material starts with early 
electrical and electronic discoveries and inventions and relates them to the 
latest emerging technologies and trends.
