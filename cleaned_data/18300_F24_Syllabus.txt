Course Description:  
This course introduces electromagnetic principles and describes ways in which those 
principles are applied in engineering devices and systems. Topics include: vector calculus 
as a mathematical foundation for field descriptions, Maxwell's equations in integral and 
differential forms with associated boundary conditions as descriptions of all 
electromagnetic principles, quasistatic electric fields in free space and in materials, 
superposition for known charge sources, conduction and polarization, resistance and 
capacitance, charge relaxation, analytic and numerical methods for electric field 
boundary value problems, quasistatic magnetic fields in free space and in materials, 
superposition for known current sources, magnetization, inductance, magnetic diffusion, 
and analytic and numerical methods for magnetic field boundary value problems. The 
course involves some discussions of contemporary applications in EM, including 
communications, biomedical applications, and wireless energy transfer. 
 
We will have some experimental demos during the lectures!

Course Wiki: 
Students are encouraged to use the ECE wiki to provide feedback about the course at:

Exams: 
Two midterm exams will be given during the class periods on the following dates:   
 
● 
Exam I: October 10 
● 
Exam II: November 14 
 
The registrar will schedule a 3-hour final examination, to be given during final exam 
week. The final exam is an essential part of assigning you a grade for the course. 
 
If, for any reason (good or bad), you do not take any of the tests, you will be assigned a 
score of zero for that test, and that score will then be dropped in the grading algorithm 
(described below). There will be no makeup tests.  
 
Assignments: 
Homework problem sets will need to be turned in on or before the due dates. Homeworks 
will be graded by the teaching staff and some of the problems will be discussed in class.

Term Project:  
Small projects will be assigned to groups of students (~3 students each group). The goal 
of these projects is to help students become familiar with the contemporary applications 
in electromagnetics. 
 
Grading Algorithm:  
Two methods will be used to compute a score for each student in the course. Each 
method has a maximum possible score of 105:   
 
Method A 
 
 
 
 
Method B   
10 % Assignments 
 
 
 
10 % Assignments 
40 % Midterm (average of the two)              25 % Midterm (lowest score dropped) 
30 % Final exam  
 
 
 
40 % Final exam  
10 % Participation credit 
 
 
10 % Participation credit 
15 % Project  
 
 
 
20 % Project 
 
Whichever method yields the highest score will be used for your final score. You will 
have 5% extra to gain! While lower cutoffs may be used, the following maximum grade 
cutoffs are guaranteed:   
 
Final Score Grade   
> 90 A   
> 80 B   
> 70 C   
> 60 D

Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes) 
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your 
education.  ABET defines 7 Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of 
all the courses you take.  The following list describes which objectives are fulfilled by 
this course and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives are numbered from “1” 
through “7” in the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by this course 
have been omitted from the following list: 
 
1. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by 
applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics: The course 
introduces many problems and questions to students, as pop-up questions during 
the lectures, problems on homeworks and exams, and for in-class exercises. The 
students will use mathematical and engineering concepts to solve simple and 
complex electromagnetic problems, both using engineering estimations and 
rigorous mathematical analysis. This includes using methods from vector algebra, 
vector calculus and complex analyses.

2. an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified 
needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, 
cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors: The students will learn the 
principles of electromagnetics to learn how wireless communication systems 
work; how magnetic hard drives operate; and how maglev trains are designed. In 
parallel, we discuss the potential harmful effects of electromagnetic waves on 
human health. Through these discussions, students learn how responsible 
engineering design can be applied to contemporary applications of 
electromagnetics. 
3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences: The course 
involves term projects, in which the students work as teams to work on a topic 
related to the course topics. The team will deliver a presentation at the end of the 
semester. These timed presentations will help students improve their 
communication skills. 
4. an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering 
situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of 
engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts 
Through the course projects, some students study the harmful effects of 
engineered systems that operate based on principles of electromagnetics on 
human health. They share their findings with the rest of the class. 
5. an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide 
leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan 
tasks, and meet objectives: Course projects are defined as team projects. Groups 
of two or three students work together on a research topic. They will coordinate 
literature survey, information analysis and preparing presentations.  
6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and 
interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions: The instructor 
performs demo experiments in class. The students observe these experiments and 
will have the opportunity to run the experiments themselves and use engineering 
concepts they have learned in this class to make sense of these experiments.  
7. an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate 
learning strategies: This course offers a broad range of concepts from physics 
concepts to engineering concepts. The students develop the ability to learn new 
knowledge by connecting fundamental concepts to engineering applications.
