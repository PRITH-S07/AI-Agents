Course Description: This course covers the design and implementation of computer systems from the perspective
of the hardware software interface. The purpose of this course is for students to understand the relationship between
the operating system, software, and computer architecture. Students that complete the course will have learned
operating system fundamentals, computer architecture fundamentals, compilation to hardware abstractions, and how
software actually executes from the perspective of the hardware software/boundary. The course will focus especially
on understanding the relationships between software and hardware, and how those relationships influence the design
of a computer system's software and hardware. The course will convey these topics through a series of practical,
implementation-oriented lab assignments.

Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes)
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your education. ABET defines 7 Educational
Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of all the courses you take. The following list describes which objectives
are fulfilled by this course and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives are numbered from “1” through “7” in
the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by this course have been omitted from the following list:
●
an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of
engineering, science, and mathematics
●
an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of
public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors
●
an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
●
an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed
judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and
societal contexts
●
an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a
collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives
●
an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use
engineering judgment to draw conclusions
●
an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
