Prerequisites: ECE 320 or equivalent 
 
Recitation and Labs: In addition to lecture, the course will have both recitations and labs. 
The recitations will provide supplemental review of material from lecture. You are free to 
attend any of the recitation sections. The labs will provide guided tutorials on the CAD 
tools. Some labs will have a pre-lab component that you must complete before coming to 
lab. Please attend your assigned lab section as the room has limited space. Recitations and 
labs will begin the second week of the semester.  
 
Assignments and grading: The course will have problem sets, labs, a midterm, a project, 
and a final exam. Problem sets are due at the beginning of class. No late problem sets will 
be accepted without prior written approval by the instructor obtained at least 24 hours 
before the due date. Re-grading of any assignment or exam will be handled exclusively by 
the instructor (do not ask the TAs or graders for a re-grade). Regrades must be requested 
in writing within a week of the assignment or exam being returned. 
 
The course grading breakdown is approximately as follows: 
10% 
Problem sets 
10% 
Labs 
20% 
Midterm 
30% 
Project 
30% 
Final exam

Collaboration and academic honesty: All work submitted for the class must be your own. 
You must write your own solutions, simulation decks, schematics, code, etc.; copying from 
others is not permitted. However, you are strongly encouraged to discuss assignments and 
check your solutions with classmates. The collaboration policy applies to all work in the 
course unless explicitly stated otherwise. For group projects, you can of course turn in joint 
work with your partner. Any instance of academic dishonesty will result in a failing grade 
(R) for the course along with departmental and university penalties. 
 
Texts and readings: There is no required text for this course. The primary reading 
materials will be the course lecture notes and selected journal and conference papers 
handed out in class and available on the course website. There are two recommended texts 
available at the bookstore. They provide useful supplemental and background material, but 
are not strictly necessary.  
• CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective (4th Ed.; Weste and 
Harris)  
 
Additionally, the following texts may prove useful: 
• Logical Effort (Sutherland, Sproull, and Harris) 
• Design of High-Performance Microprocessor Circuits (Chandrakasan, et al.)

Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes)  
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your education. ABET defines 7 
Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of all the courses you take. The following list 
describes which objectives are fulfilled by 18-422/622 and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives 
are numbered from “1” through “7” in the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by 18-
422/622 have been omitted from the following list. 
 
1. An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of 
engineering, science, and mathematics. The course poses many problems; on homework, in labs, during 
exams, and for in-class exercises; for the student to formulate and solve using good engineering practice. The 
student will use mathematical and engineering concepts to model and design digital circuits and to solve 
complex problems in the digital design and computer architecture domain. 
 
2. An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with 
consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, 
and economic factors. The course is an introduction to the design of digital circuits, so the student will start 
to gain insight into the process of designing components and then designing systems using those components. 
Some economic and manufacturability constraints will be discussed. At all appropriate points, safety will be 
emphasized. 
 
3. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences. Students practice their communication 
skills during laboratory exercises as well as the basic written communication of problem solutions on 
homework and exams. In all such cases, the audience is small. During a large active-learning exercise, 
students review their team's work and report results to the class. 
 
5. An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a 
collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. Students will 
operate in 2-person teams for the final project. These are not multi-disciplinary teams, but the student will 
start to learn teamwork and team management skills, particularly conflict resolution.  
 
6. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use 
engineering judgment to draw conclusions. Laboratory exercises provide for the opportunity to conduct 
experiments. The student will design experiments and analyze data throughout the debugging process in order 
to generate a functioning lab. 
 
7. An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. 
During the project and exams, students will encounter new design challenges in which they will need to apply 
learned knowledge to overcome.
