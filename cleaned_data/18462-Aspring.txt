Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes) 
 
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your education. ABET defines 7 
Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of all the courses you take. The following list 
describes which objectives are fulfilled by 18-725 and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives are 
numbered from “1” through “7” in the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by 18-725 
have been omitted from the following list. 
 
They are: 
1. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of 
engineering, science, and mathematics  
 
The IC design project will comprise a large number of engineering problems to solve at various levels of the 
design stack. You will need to apply the engineering skills you’ve learned in previous classes to make design 
choices and trade-offs in order to complete the chip design.  
 
2. an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration 
of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors 
 
One of the early tasks in the class is to devise a set of target specifications for your chip design. This will 
serve as the guiding goal for your engineering choices as you progress through the design process.  
 
3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences 
 
Across the various meetings and design reviews in the class, you will need to discuss your design and 
methodologies with the course staff, other students, and professional engineers. There will be multiple formal 
presentations as well as less formal meetings in the class.  
 
4. an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make 
informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, 
environmental, and societal contexts 
 
Students using 18-725 as an undergraduate capstone will engage with 18-500 course material, assignments, 
and lectures to address this need.  
 
5. an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a 
collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives 
 
You will work in teams of 2-4 students to complete your IC design. Additionally, you will need to collaborate 
with the course staff, other teams, and professional engineers.  
 
6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use 
engineering judgment to draw conclusions  
 
Throughout the IC design, you will need to create and conduct various experiments (primarily using 
architectural and circuit simulation) that will guide your design choices. You will need to analyze and 
interpret the results of these simulations in order to make good engineering choices.  
 
7. an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. 
 
Taping out an IC is fundamentally different from course work and projects, as you need to fully verify your 
design and take it from 99% done to 100% done, as there is very little room for error in IC design. And the 
main onus for a broken design is on the students as they will have to test and debug the chip in 18-726. 
Further, 18-725 address a number of design for test and design for manufacturability concerns that are not 
address in other courses.
