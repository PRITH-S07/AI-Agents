Course Description: This course gives engineering insight into the operation of 
excitable cells, as well as circuitry for sensing and stimulation nerves. Initial background 
topics include diffusion, osmosis, drift, and mediated transport, culminating in the Nernst 
equation of cell potential. We will then explore models of the nerve, including electrical 
circuit models and the Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical model. Finally, we will explore 
aspects of inducing a nerve to fire artificially, and cover circuit topologies for sensing 
action potentials and for stimulating nerves. We will also discuss other aspects of medical 
device design. Students will complete a neural stimulator or sensor or Hodgkin-Huxley 
simulation project. 
 
Differentiation between 42-433/18-412 and 42-733/18-612: Although students in 42-
433/18-412 and 42-733/18-612 will share lectures and recitations, students in the 
undergraduate and graduate versions may receive different homework assignments, 
design problems, and exams. The homework assignments, design problems, and exams 
that are given to the students registered for the graduate version will be more challenging 
than those given to students registered for the undergraduate version, and students 
registered for 42-733/18-612 will be graded on a different curve from students registered 
for 42-433/18-412.
