Course Description:  
 
Web browsers are becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers who wish to 
compromise users' systems or steal data from users. This course will study the architecture 
of modern browsers, vulnerabilities in these browsers, as well as new technologies for 
enhancing the functionality and security of browsers. Students will be assigned research 
papers on relevant topics. Topics of study include (but are not limited to) browser 
encryption, extension and plug-in security, authentication, privacy, browser policies, and 
JavaScript security. This course will involve a project as well as small assignments. 
Students will present their projects in class and write a final report on the projects.
