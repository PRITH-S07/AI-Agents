Course Description: This course will help masters and undergraduate students to obtain the 
background necessary for excelling in courses and careers in machine learning, artificial 
intelligence, and related fields. We will cover basic concepts of probability prerequisite to 
understanding the material typically taught in a ML course. We will also cover slightly more 
advanced topics including Markov Chains, hypothesis testing, and maximum-likelihood 
estimation. The remaining part of the semester will be devoted to introducing machine learning 
concepts such as supervised/unsupervised learning, model identification, clustering, expectation 
maximization, etc. Students should be familiar with basic calculus, linear algebra. 
 
Although students in 18465 will share lectures with students in 18665, students in 18465 may 
receive distinct homework assignments and exams from the ones given to students in 18665. 
Specifically, the homework assignments and exams that are given to the 18665 students will be 
more challenging than those given to the 18465 students.

Education 
Objectives 
(Relationship 
of 
Course 
to 
Program 
Outcomes) 
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your 
education.  ABET defines 7 Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of all 
the courses you take.  The following list describes which objectives are fulfilled by 18-
665/465 and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives are numbered from “1” 
through “7” in the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by 18-665/465 
have been omitted from the following list: 
1. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems 
by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics: 
The course involves many problems on homework assignments, in 
recitations, and during exams for the student to formulate and solve 
using good engineering practice. The student will use mathematical 
concepts for analysis, performance modeling and design of complex 
engineering systems in the domains of machine learning, hypothesis 
testing, and Markov Chains.    
6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze 
and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions 
The course involves many problems on homework assignments that will 
require the student to run computer experiments, several of which 
involve data acquisition and processing, to test hypotheses and gain 
hands-on experience with the implications of theoretical results. 
7. an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using 
appropriate learning strategies.

Several homework problems will require the student think outside of 
lecture material and find different approaches through their own 
research.
