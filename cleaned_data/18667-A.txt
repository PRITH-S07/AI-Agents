Course Description:  
 
The objective of this course is to introduce students to state-of-the-art algorithms in large-
scale machine learning and distributed optimization. Students will read and critique a 
curated set of research papers. A key discussion topic will be distributed stochastic gradient 
descent, and how to scale it to a distributed computing system, and to the federated learning 
framework where edge devices are used for training. Topics to be covered include but are 
not limited to mini-batch SGD and its convergence analysis, momentum and variance 
reduction methods, synchronous and asynchronous SGD, local-update SGD, decentralized 
SGD, gradient compression/quantization, data heterogeneity in federated learning, 
computational heterogeneity in federated learning, personalization, fairness, participation 
incentives, differential privacy and secure aggregation in federated learning. Each lecture 
will cover some latest research papers, and discuss open problems.

Pre-requisites: 18-661, 18-660 (either before or concurrently with this course), 
undergraduate probability and linear algebra  
 
Graduate Area: Algorithms   
 
Class Lecture: Mon/Wed 10:00-11:50 am, Remote Only 
 
Class Recitation: Fri 9:00-9:50 am, Remote only 
 
Suggested Reading: Material covered in the first part of the class is also in Prof. Joshi's 
book on Optimization Algorithms for Distributed Machine Learning, available through 
CMU libraries. 
 
Reference Materials:  Students are expected to read the research paper discussed in each 
lecture and review the lecture slides to prepare for the quizzes and homework 
assignments. 
 
Course Canvas:  
Canvas login page: https://cmu.instructure.com/. You should check the course Canvas 
daily for announcements and handouts.  
 
Course Website: https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/18-667/ 
 
Homeworks (40%): There will be 4 equally weighted homeworks, each consisting of a 
mix of mathematical and implementation questions. You are given 3 late days (self-
granted 24-hr extensions) which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty. 
At most one late day can be used per assignment. This will be monitored automatically 
via Gradescope. Solutions will be graded on both correctness and clarity. If you cannot 
solve a problem completely, you will get more partial credit by identifying the gaps in 
your argument than by attempting to cover them up. 
 
Collaboration Policy 
Group studying and collaborating on problem sets are encouraged, as working together is 
a great way to understand new material.  Students are free to discuss the homework 
problems with anyone under the following conditions: 
• Students must write their own solutions and understand the solutions that they 
wrote down.  
• Students must list the names of their collaborators (i.e., anyone with whom the 
assignment was discussed).  
• Students may not use old solution sets from other classes under any 
circumstances, unless the instructor grants special permission. 
 
Project (15%): Students will form teams of 3-4 to conduct a detailed literature survey 
and/or original research and/or implementation on one of the project topics listed on the 
course website. Projects on a topic outside this list are also welcome -- please contact the 

 
3 
 
instructor to discuss your idea. At the end of semester, each team will need to submit a 4-
page review paper and give a 15-min project presentation. 
 
Quizzes (45%): There will be 3 equally weighted in-class quizzes. Each quiz will be a 
mix of multiple-choice and descriptive questions. Every quiz will only be based on the 
lectures and papers discussed during that module of the class. 
 
Reading Assignments: Papers are listed on the course website alongside each lecture. 
 
Grading Algorithm: On a curve based on relative performance of students in the class.

applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics 
2. an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified 
needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, 
cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors 
3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences 
4. an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering 
situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of 
engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts 
5. an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide 
leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan

6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and 
interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions 
7. an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate 
learning strategies.
