Course Description:  
Nonlinear optics plays an indispensable role in modern photonics and is the driving force 
behind many important applications. Examples include frequency mixing in the classical 
domain and entangled photon sources in the quantum domain. This course aims to provide 
practical yet broad coverage on nonlinear optics, focusing both on the theoretical and 
experimental aspects of this subject. For example, by introducing nonlinear susceptibility 
to classical EM wave equations based on the coupled mode theory, we will study two key 
concepts of nonlinear optics: phase matching and energy conservation, in the context of 
various second- or third-order nonlinear processes. In addition, key experimental sessions 
are provided so that students can reinforce the learnt knowledge through hands-on 
experience. Finally, we will also cover the basics of quantum optics relevant to this course, 
which will help prepare students for future research work in the quantum area. Quantum 
applications such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion and quantum frequency 
conversion will be discussed.
