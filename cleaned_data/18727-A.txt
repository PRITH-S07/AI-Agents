Course Description:  
Come learn what 5G/6G cellular communications is all about and why it will be such a 
major breakthrough compared to 3G and 4G cellular. 
     
 
 
This class will teach you how radios work (at a block level) and just enough theory about 
RF wave propagation to understand multipath interference and other key aspects of RF 
communications systems. Our context will be the future in which every device wants to 
communicate with the world (i.e., the Internet-of-Things). 
 
The learning process will include a significant hands-on component. Students will build 
and test RF transmission lines, RF patch antennas and a simple MIMO radio front end / 
antenna array. We will explore key concepts like multipath interference, beam forming, 
beam steering and null steering via the LAB exercises. 
 
Number of Units: 12 
 
Pre-requisites: 18-320 and 18-290, or permission of instructor.  
Seniors and Graduate Students who are interested in the future of RF communications 
and who have taken at least Undergraduate circuits (e.g., 18-320) and Intro to Signal 
Processing (e.g., 18-290) or equivalent should be able to succeed in this class. In 
addition, students should be familiar with programming in Python.

Title:  
Microwave and RF Design 
Author:  
Steer, Michael  
Abstract:  
The book series Microwave and RF Design is a comprehensive treatment of 
radio frequency (RF) and microwave design with a modern “systems-first” 
approach. A strong emphasis on design permeates the series with extensive 
case studies and design examples. Design is oriented towards cellular 
communications and microstrip design so that lessons learned can be

applied to real-world design tasks. The books in the Microwave and RF 
Design series consists of 6 volumes: Fundamentals of Microwave and RF 
Design, Radio Systems (Volume 1), Transmission Lines (Volume 2), 
Networks (Volume 3), Modules (Volume 4), and Amplifiers and 
Oscillators (Volume 5). 
Description: Print versions of these volumes are available for order through UNC Press -

Course Canvas:  
Canvas login page: https://cmu.instructure.com/. All course materials will be posted on 
the 18-727 Canvas website.  You should check the course Canvas site daily for 
announcements and handouts.  
 
Homework Assignments:  
The students will be expected to perform approximately 6 homework assignments during 
the semester. 
 
Lab Exercises:  
The students will be expected to perform approximately bi-weekly Lab exercise 
assignments typically on Fridays. When Lab exercises are not being held on Fridays, we 
will hold either Recitation sections to go over homeworks or makeup Lectures to cover 
now material. We will announce the schedule for the following week at least a week 
ahead of time. Lab exercises will be in teams of 2 or 3 students depending on the total 
number of students and the number of Lab setups available. 
 
Quizzes:  
The students will be given 4 in-class Quizzes during the semester in order for them to 
demonstrate that they are keeping up with the course material.

Grading:  
 
The students will carry out individual weekly homework assignments, 4 in-class quizzes 
and regular LAB assignments. The relative point breakdown for these three assignments 
is as follows.  However, we reserve the right to adjust these weights as the semester 
progresses.

Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes) 
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your 
education.  ABET defines 7 Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of 
all the courses you take.  The following list describes which objectives are fulfilled by 
this course and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives are numbered from “1” 
through “7” in the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by this course 
have been omitted from the following list: 
 
1. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by 
applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics 
 
Homework assignments, Lab exercises and Exams all require the students to 
identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying 
principles of engineering, science, and mathematics 
 
2. an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified 
needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, 
cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors 
 
Lectures provide detailed understanding of how cellular radios share spectrum as 
a resource for the mutual benefit of all users.  In addition, the important increase 
in spectrum reuse enable by MIMO is described in terms of its engineering 
design. 
 
3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences 
 
Students provide written Lab reports on their weekly Lab exercises that 
communicate what was done, the results, and any necessary interpretation of the 
results. Feedback on their Lab reports is provided weekly by course TAs. 
 
6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and 
interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions 
 
Students carry out weekly weekly Lab exercises that challenge them to design an 
appropriate experiment, analyze and interpret the results and use engineering 
judgement to draw conclusions.  Feedback on their Lab reports is provided 
weekly by course TAs. 
 
7. an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate 
learning strategies. 
 
Students are given a number of different resources to help them solve the weekly 
homework assignments. They are encouraged to gain experience searching 
through multiple sources in order to extract the information needed to solve the 
assignments.
