Course Description:  
A wide array of communication and data protections employ cryptographic mechanisms. 
This course explores modern cryptographic techniques in some detail. The course 
emphasizes how cryptographic mechanisms can be effectively used within larger security 
systems, and the dramatic ways in which cryptographic mechanisms can fail. Topics 
covered include cryptographic primitives such as block ciphers, symmetric 
(authenticated) encryption, message authentication codes, hash functions, commitments, 
public key encryption, digital signatures, and pseudo-random number generation. The 
course also covers cryptographic protocols, such as key exchange, remote user 
authentication, undeniable signatures, interactive proof systems and zero knowledge 
proofs; threshold cryptography, oblivious transfers, and secure multi-party computations; 
perfectly secure encryption and universal hash functions. The course also covers a variety 
of special applications including computing on encrypted data, fully homomorphic 
encryption, verifiable computation, and post-quantum cryptographic constructs. 
 
Course Goals: 
Provide the students with an understanding of:  
•    Basic principles of modern cryptography. 
• 
Precise security deﬁnitions for cryptographic primitives and adversary models. 
• 
Correct use of cryptographic primitives in practice. 
• 
Role of cryptography within the IT security area. 
 
Course relevance:  
This course is relevant for all students who intend to work in the security and privacy 
area. In particular, the course is relevant for students who plan to   
• analyze cryptographic primitives of national and international standards as well 
their specific implementation in systems, networks and applications  
• analyse cruptographic protocols and their use in support of security and privacy 
goals.  
• identify vulnerabilities and countermeasures in both cryptographic primitives and 
protocols.  
• apply knowledge of cryptography in new applications areas, such as computing 
on encrypted data, blockchanins, verifiable computations.  
• undestand the theoretical and practical limits of crptography in system security 
and privacy.
