Course Description:                                   Canvas Page: https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/45810  
♦ This course focuses on the investigation of biologically inspired neural networks that mimic both the 
functional behavior as well as organizational structure of the mammalian brain, with the objective of 
engineering silicon-based implementations possessing brain-like capabilities.  ♦ This course introduces a 
taxonomy of Neural Networks (NN) based on: 1) Neuron Model, 2) Neural Coding, and 3) Learning Paradigm. 
We adopt a theory of the neocortex (“A Thousand Brains”) that proposes Cortical Columns (CC) as the building 
blocks for intelligence. This course explores the potential of designing Cortical Columns Computing Systems 
(C3S) that exhibit both brain-like processing capability and brain-like energy efficiency.  ♦ Students will work 
in small teams to pursue semester long projects exploring and prototyping C3S designs, targeting sensory 
processing applications. These team projects can potentially span Applications, Architectures, Hardware 
Designs, CMOS implementations, and Design Tools.  Each team gets to define and carry out a specific project 
with support and guidance from the teaching staff.  Each team is expected to make multiple project presentations 
and produce a final project report at the end of the semester. Some of these project reports could potentially be 
turned into submittable papers with additional follow-up work (not required). These team projects can help 
prepare students for joining innovation teams developing AI/ML/DL accelerators in industry or research teams 
pursuing neuromorphic computing research that can potentially impact the industry in 3-5 years.
