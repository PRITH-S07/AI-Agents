Course Description 
Autonomous vehicles (AVs) promise to (a) significantly reduce or even eliminate 
fatalities, injuries and damage from automotive crashes; (b) replace driving times with 
other productive work; and (c) provide independence, flexibility and a better quality of 
life to legally-blind and differently-abled individuals by giving them transportation 
options.   At the same time, driving is one of the most complex tasks performed by 
humans on a regular basis.  Put together, autonomous driving has become a deep 
engineering and technological challenge of our times.  This course will expose students to 
the software architecture used in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and discuss in-depth each of 
the many layers underlying AVs. These layers include sensing, perception, localization, 
driving behaviors, route planning, path planning, vehicular communications, control, 
fault management and user interfaces. Lectures will be partly discussion-oriented and 
may require the reading of book chapters or papers. Project groups of no more than 3 
students each will design, implement and test a unique project that adds a notable 
function to an AV’s software stack. Intermediate and final project demonstrations outside 
lecture hours will be supplemented by in-class project presentations and a final written 
report. Grading criteria will include classroom participation, course project content and 
report, in-class quizzes and a final exam. The class size will be limited to 30 students. 
Prior hands-on knowledge of and experience with machine learning/computer vision, 
linear algebra, calculus, physics and statistics are essential. Exposure to mobile robotics 
will be advantageous. Exceptions can be made only with the explicit permission of the 
instructor.

Class Participation 
 
Final grades will be assigned based on the following rules:  
• 
If you score more than 90%, you get an 'A' grade guaranteed.  
• 
If you score more than 80%, you are guaranteed to get a 'B' grade.  
• 
If you score more than 70%, you are guaranteed to get a 'C' grade.  
• 
If you score less than 70%, you are guaranteed to get a ‘D’ grade. 
A curve will be fit by instructor discretion if a sufficient number of students do not meet 
the above criteria.
