Course Description: This course provides a fundamental understanding of probability 
theory and its applications to stochastic systems. The course covers the basic concepts of 
random variables, random vectors, stochastic processes, and random fields. In addition, 
common random processes such as Markov chains, Wiener and Gaussian processes are 
introduced. The course touches on elements of estimation theory and optimal filtering 
including Wiener and Kalman filtering. Advanced topics in modern statistical signal 
processing such as linear prediction, linear models and spectrum estimation are also 
discussed.  Throughout the course, students will gain hands-on experience in applying the 
concepts to solve a wide range of complex and relevant problems.

Assignment Policy: Homework not turned before the due will lose 20%. Each additional 
day loses another 20%. The lowest homework and quiz grade will be dropped. While 
students in class are encouraged to discuss the assigned problems, each student should 
write and submit their own solution and should not copy the solutions of other students. 
This policy will be strictly enforced in this class. If you have any question about whether 
some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask.  
 
Attendance: Every student is expected to attend every class for the whole class duration. 
Attendance will be checked randomly using different means, including a pop quiz that also 
assesses the reading assignment. Unexplained absence will result in deduction of point in 
the attendance score. The attendance score will also include various ways, such as 
answering your colleague's questions on Piazza, or being active during class.  If you need 
to miss a lecture because of a medical emergency or something equally significant, please 
inform the instructor before the start of the class.

needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, 
cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors 
3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences 
4. an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering 
situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of 
engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts 
5. an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide 
leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan
