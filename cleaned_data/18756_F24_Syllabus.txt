Course Description:  
This first level graduate course in networking provides an understanding of the key 
concepts in networks through lectures, seminars, and projects. The topics include Transport 
networks, MPLS, GMPLS, Optical transport networks, packet switch architectures, QoS, 
Routing, network virtualization (SDN), and other advanced topics in networks including 
Cloud Computing and Blockchain.  
This course is particularly useful for those students who would like to gain a fundamental 
understanding of the principles of operation of communication and data networks and to 
have careers in networks as well as those who would like to do their M.Sc. or Ph.D. 
thesis in this area. The course will assume that the students have a basic understanding of 
probability Theory and an elementary understanding of computer networks.

Grading:  
 
Paper Reviews 
You are expected to read papers and submit review reports throughout the course. The 
paper review reports are worth 10 % of the final grade.   
 
Course Problem Sets and Projects 
The problem sets will be assigned throughout the course. The problem sets will be based 
on course materials including papers. The problem sets are due in the class one week 
after they are assigned (unless you are told otherwise). There are also network software 
projects. The objective of the project is to explore concepts covered during the lectures 
through implementation and experiments. The problem sets and the projects are worth 
20% of the final grade. Details on the projects will be announced later.   
 
All assignments are due 12:00am (EST), midnight, on due dates.   
All work submitted late will be counted as zero.
