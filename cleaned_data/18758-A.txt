Pre-requisites: 18-290 or equivalent, and 36-217 or equivalent, and some exposure to 
MATLAB. These pre-requisites are not formally enforced, but you will need to have that 
background from your undergraduate university to understand this course material. 
 
Number of Units: 12 
 
Graduate Area:  Signals and Systems, Signal Processing and Communications 
 
Course Description: In this course, the wireless communication problem will be 
introduced, and channel impairments such as noise, inter-symbol interference and fading 
will be described. Solutions to combat these impairments, based on digital communication 
theory, will be described. These will include signal space analysis, detection, equalization,

coding and diversity, and advanced topics such as OFDM, MIMO and 5G cellular standard. 
Examples drawn from communication standards will illustrate how the theory is 
implemented in practical wireless communication systems. A course project will allow 
students to implement a working digital wireless system utilizing software radio hardware. 
 
Computing: 
Some homework assignments and the course project will require the use of Matlab. This is 
widely available on ECE machines, or you can obtain a free student license for your 
personal computer from CMU Software. 
 
Textbook: 
Course notes will be handed out. No textbook is required. If you need a reference, you 
could try one of the books below, but that is not required. 
1. A. Molisch, Wireless Communications, Wiley-IEEE Press; 2nd edition, 2010. 
2. A. Goldsmith, Wireless Communications, Cambridge University Press, 2005.

Homeworks: 
• Homeworks or Assignments will be handed out on Tuesdays or Thursdays and 
will be due in one week, by 11:59 pm on the due date marked on the homework or 
assignment.  
• Homeworks will typically require in-depth understanding of topics and more 
work, and will be handed out in the first half of the semester. Scan your 
homework and upload it to Canvas (under ‘Assignments’), preferably a single file 
in pdf format. If you upload single images, label their filenames with the page 
number, as h1.jpg, h2.jpg, etc. Matlab code should be uploaded as *.m file, and 
also as a pdf or image file for visual inspection in Canvas. 
• Assignments (as opposed to ‘Homeworks’) will be short, with multiple-choice 
type answers for most questions, and will only test awareness of topics. These 
will be used in the second half of the semester, since the course project will 
occupy most of your time then. Assignments can be done interactively directly 
in Canvas. 
• Graded Homeworks and Exams can be downloaded from Canvas. 
• No late submissions are allowed without prior permission, and permission will only 
be granted in the most extreme situations. 
• Since no late submissions are allowed, your lowest Homework score will be 
dropped and your lowest Assignment score will also be dropped, as specified in the 
Grading Algorithm.  
 
 
Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes): 
 
1. 
an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying 
principles of engineering, science, and mathematics: 
The course applies undergraduate calculus, probability and linear systems theory, along 
with engineering design principles and trade-offs, to the design of digital wireless 
communication systems. 
 
2. 
an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified 
needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, 
social, environmental, and economic factors: 
Homeworks, exams and a course project pose questions about communication 
system design using the principles learnt in class. A discussion of the 
“commons” issue in communications (especially wireless) is provided, in the 
context of usage of spectrum. 
 
3. 
an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences. 
The course project requires presentations to elaborate on the system designed 
and to explain any new technology that has been implemented. 
 
6. 
an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and 
interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions:  
A project component allows adaptive learning by transmitting, receiving and analyzing 

5 
 
signals sent through a communication channel. 
 
7. 
an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate 
learning strategies: 
A part of the course project is to read research papers to understand a technology and 
then implement it.
