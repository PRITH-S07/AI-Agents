Course Description 
• 
Adopting Artificial Intelligence in modern era has much more to it than learning the theoretical foundation of AI 
algorithms. The implementation of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at large scale requires solid 
technical infrastructure to support its complex, heavy processes. In this course, students will learn to be effective 
users of AI systems. Students will gain hands-on experience with modern ML frameworks and infrastructure tools, 
in the context of large real-world datasets and under conditions requiring engineering design choices. This 
experience will be gained in conjunction with practical application of class topics on real cloud environment.  
 
• 
The premise of this course is to build a broad and solid foundation in Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure that will 
pay significant dividends throughout a student’s research and work career across data science and Artificial 
Intelligence related fields. In this class, we will focus on the following topics: 
 
o 
Data Collection and Storage. 
o 
Data Streaming.

o 
Deployment of ML Models to the Cloud. 
 
• 
The course material will focus on recent and landmark research papers and existing tools and software systems. 
Students will have substantial programming project work in which they design, implement, and analyze aspects of 
AI-model infrastructure. This course will use an IoT-relevant dataset throughout the semester. The format of this 
course will be a mix of lectures and hands-on labs. Students will be responsible for readings, and completing a 
hands-on project focused on developing applications on Apache Spark, TensorFlow, PyTorch Apache Kafka, 
PostgreSQL and NoSQL. Readings will be selected from recent conference proceedings and journals.  
 
• 
Prerequisites: Practical experience in Python is highly preferable and exposure to machine learning experience 
is preferred. There will be a Python lecture offered in the second week of the class to help the students who 
needs a Python refresher. If you have questions about your programming experience, please let me know at the 
beginning of the semester, so we can decide how to proceed. 
 
• 
Class Structure: Lectures will be synchronous, and attendance is required. Lecture slides are delivered via 
TopHat, an online course delivery system. TopHat can be accessed on a smartphone or laptop. For this purpose, 
I will ask you in advance to bring your laptop or mobile device, and we will review how to use the tool together in 
class. If you do not have the necessary equipment, please contact your HUB liaison who is available to help you 
tap into appropriate resources. Join code will be posted on Canvas. In addition, lecture materials will be offered 
via Jupyter Notebooks. 
Learning Objectives  
In taking and successfully completing this course, students will learn how to, e.g.,  
 
• 
apply best practices in collecting, storing, and modeling data of various size; 
• 
gain hands-on experience in building and analyzing large-scale AI infrastructure components and 
developing and testing services that operate within them;  
• 
practice the implementation of large-scale AI algorithms in modern machine-learning frameworks;  
• 
implement data engineering pipelines to streamline the development of complex AI-models;  
•

Students are expected to check the course webpage on canvas regularly for announcements, class 
schedules, lecture notes, homework assignments, reading assignments, and other related course material. 
● 
Assignments will be submitted online via GitHub Org URLs. For this purpose, sign up for a (free) account at 
GitHub. 
● 
Homework and Project assignments must be turned in prior to their specified deadline. Typically, homework 
is due one week after it is assigned unless otherwise mentioned. 
● 
Students are strongly encouraged to complete the assignments as early as they can. No homework 
extensions will be offered due to technical difficulties. 
● 
Students will have 3 days to submit an assignment after the due date and a late penalty will be applied. 
Late penalties are applied based on the timestamp of the last code commit on GitHub and it will follow this 
equation: 
● 
1 point for each 1 hour of delay up to 24 hours delay (You will get TA support at specific time slots on 
Zoom and Piazza) 
● 
24 points for the next 24 hours delay (You will get TA support at specific time slots on Piazza only) 
● 
24 points for the next 24 hours delay (No TA support is provided). 
● 
100 points penalty (no grade) after this time. 
● 
Late submissions for the course project will receive no grade (0 points).  
● 
After homework and project grades are released, a Canvas announcement will be made with a link to submit 
regrade requests. Regrade requests can be made for 24 hours via the URL that is provided on the 
Canvas announcement and CANNOT be submitted via email. 
● 
For grading questions, email the TA or ask your question during TA office hours. If you continue to have an 
issue with the grading, you may ask your question during instructor’s office hours. 
● 
Students are encouraged to read their privacy rights in Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

If you have materials-related questions, you can post them on Piazza or ask them during instructor’s office 
hours. You should plan to receive the question responses on Piazza during office hours’ allocated time. 
• 
You may email personal inquiries and severe emergencies to the instructor(s). The email subject line should 
begin with "14-763” or “18-763”. Emails sent to the instructor should be 2-3 lines maximum and the 
instructor’s response will not be more than few words. Generally, the course instructor is available to 
respond to personal inquiries during M-F 9am-8pm ET. Please don’t expect responses over the weekend or 
late at night. 
Expectations for Class Attendance 
● 
Classes will be offered synchronously and in-person only.  
● 
Students are highly encouraged to follow the schedule of their registered section. During every lecture, a 
quiz is released only to the registered students of the corresponding section.  
● 
Class attendance and participation are important parts of the learning in this course. To account for this, a 
portion of the final grade is based on quizzes that are offered during the lectures (see assessment section). 
That said, I also recognize that students may need to miss class for a variety of reasons (religious 
observance, job interview, university-sanctioned event, or illness). For that reason, all students are 
permitted two class absences without any impact on the final grade. If you encounter extenuating 
circumstances and must miss more than two classes, please email the course instructor for further 
guidance. 
• 
When attending the class in-person, I expect that you will abide by all behaviors indicated in A Tartan’s 
Responsibility, including any timely updates based on the current conditions.  
Recording of Class Sessions 
● 
Class recordings will be available after each lecture. Please note it may take a few hours for the recording to 
become available. The Class recordings will be published on Canvas.
