Deep Generative Modeling
CMU 18-789 - Spring 2025
Course Description
This course will explore the basics of deep generative modeling. It will cover common model paradigms including
variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, normalizing flow models, diffusion models, and autoregressive
models. Students will learn the relative advantages and disadvantages of different model choices, as well as the
fundamental design choices that went into each idea. Students will get a chance to explore and present cutting-edge
research, and will also implement and experiment with generative models through a course project.
Prerequisite: Knowledge about basic machine learning from 18-661 or equivalent. Proficiency in at least one programming
language - preferably Python.

Late Days
You have 5 late days, no questions asked. To use them, just write at the top of your assignment, “I am using x of my late
days for this assignment.”
Student Presentations
There will be 3 student presentation sessions, each one will have 3 papers presented by students.
There will be 2 presentations for each paper:
1 summarizing the significance of the paper (~15 mins, no more than 3 speakers)
1 summarizing areas of improvement for the paper(~10 mins, no more than 2 speakers)
Please sign up for a presentation here

usp=sharing&ouid=103741030008966705821&rtpof=true&sd=true). Your presentations will be evaluated based on this
rubric (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UkJHFqeOrGqQ0yb7AxOCkecieWMWDNmNmUuWMNcBDT4/edit?

Usage of GenAI Tools
You may not use AI tools for any homework, quizzes, or during the midterm, as this cannot be considered a substitute
for developing the fundamental skills and expertise represented by the learning objectives of this course.
It is allowed to use generative AI tools in your project development and presentation preparation. However, their use must
be appropriately acknowledged and cited. For instance, if you generated a particular paragraph or slide through
ChatGPT and edited it for accuracy, your submitted work would need to include a note such as “I generated this part
through ChatGPT and edited the content for accuracy.” Paraphrasing or quoting smaller samples of AI generated content
must be appropriately acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines established by the APA Style Guide
(https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt). It is each student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability
of any AI output that is submitted. You may not earn full credit if inaccurate on invalid information is found in your work.
Deviations from the guidelines above will be considered violations of CMU’s academic integrity policy
(https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html).

The schedule is tentative and subject to change.
