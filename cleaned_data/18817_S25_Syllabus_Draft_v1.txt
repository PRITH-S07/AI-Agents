Course Description:  
 
This course provides students with a foundation of the physics required to understand 
nanometer-scale structures while exposing them to different aspects of ongoing research in 
nanoscience and nanotechnology. Illustrative examples will be drawn from semiconductor 
nanostructures, including their applications in novel and next-generation electronic, 
photonic, and sensing devices. The course begins with a review of basic concepts in 
quantum physics (wave-particle duality, the Schrödinger equation, particle-in-a-box model 
for electronic confinement, approximation methods in quantum mechanics, etc.) and then 
continues with discussion of bulk three-dimensional solids (band structure, density of 
states, the single-electron effective-mass approximation). Size effects due to nanometer-
scale spatial localization are then discussed within a quantum-confinement model in one-, 
two-, and three- dimensions for electrons. An analogous discussion for photons is 
presented. The basic electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of low-dimensional 
nanostructures are then discussed. A select number of applications in electronics, 
photonics, chemistry, and bioengineering will be discussed to illustrate the range of utility 
of nanostructures. Upon completion of the course, students will have an appreciation and 
understanding of the fundamental concepts in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The 
course is suitable for first-year graduate students in engineering and science but advanced 
undergraduates with appropriate backgrounds may also take it with permission from the 
instructor.

2. Energy band structure: Periodic crystalline solids and the semiconductor band 
structure.  
3. Semiconductor nanostructures: quantum wells, quantum wires, and quantum dots.

There will be 2 one-class-period Tests, each worth 100 points; seven (7) Problem Sets, 
each worth 10 points, and one (1) special assignment (to be specified after Spring break).   
 
7 Problem Sets (only 6 are counted toward final grade) +30% (+60 points) 
2 Tests 
+50% (+200 points) 
Special Assignment  
 
+20% (20 points) 
 
Note: While lower cutoffs may be used, the following cutoffs are guaranteed:  
 
Final Grade Points  
A 
249.2 to 280 points (89 to 100%) 
B 
221.2 to 246.4 (79 to 88%) 
C 
193.2 to 218.4 (69 to 78%) 
 
Homework:  
 
Homework will be assigned approximately every two to three weeks. Assignments and 
solutions will be posted on Canvas. It is the student’s responsibility to login to Canvas each 
week for assignments and announcements. There will be a total of 7 Problem Sets assigned. 
Homework will always be due at the beginning of lecture on the dates shown on the 
assignment. No late homework will be accepted unless prior arrangements have been made 
or permission is requested. Any homework submitted after lecture on the day on which it 
is due will be considered late.  
 
Working with other students in the class is encouraged; however, each student must turn 
in their own original work. Sharing computer programs or methods used to solve 
homework problems is not allowed. All work handed in for grading must be neat and 
organized (or else it may not be graded).  
 
Grading of Homework:  
 
If you believe an error has been made in the grading of your homework assignment, you 
must bring this fact to the attention of the TA within one week of when the work was 
returned to you. After this time period, no requests for re-grading will be honored. 
 
 
Handouts:  
 
From time to time, additional material for the course may be given in the form of handouts. 
If not given out during lecture, these materials will be available on Canvas.  
 
General Re-grading Policy:  
 
All materials submitted for re-grading must be submitted within one week from the time 
they were available for student pick-up. Any material submitted for re-grading is subject 
to the entire document being re-graded, not only the portion the student has asked to be 
looked at. It is important to note that this could potentially result in a lowering of one’s 
grade on that material.

Special Circumstances Policy:  
 
If you have permission for “Special Circumstances” for exam taking from Disabled Student 
Services, it is your responsibility to remind the instructor at least 72 hours prior to the exam 
of your needs, otherwise you may be subject to taking your exam at the same time and 
place (and for the same length of time) as the rest of the class. 
 
Office Hours:  
 
The instructor and the TA have office hours. If you are unable to meet during the scheduled 
times, please send e-mail to arrange for an appointment.  
 
Cheating and Plagiarism:  
 
It shall be the policy of this course to discourage cheating and plagiarism. Anyone caught 
cheating will be reported to the Dean of Student Affairs for disciplinary action. Please refer 
to the University Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism.

Educational Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes): 
 
After completion of this course, students are expected to:  
 
(a) Have acquired the ability to apply knowledge in science, mathematics, and engineering 
in the domain of nanoscience and nano-engineering. This ability will be acquired through 
learning basic quantum mechanics, solid state physics, and the associated mathematics 
relevant to designing electronic and photonic devices based on semiconductor 
nanostructures. Experience will be acquired through exercises in homework problems, 
some of which require computational tools.  
 
(b) Have acquired the ability to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines (physics, 
mathematics, materials science, chemistry, and electrical engineering) to effectively 
understand the principles behind nanotechnology.  
 
(c) Come to a recognition of the need for and the ability to engage in independent life-long 
learning.  
 
(d) Have developed the ability to use techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools 
necessary for engineering practice; in particular, students are expected to become familiar 
with use of standard mathematical software packages such as Mathematica or MATLAB.
