Course Description:  
 
This mini-course examines the human-aided monitoring, planning, and decision making 
that enable reliable, secure and safe operation of an electric power system, on the time 
scale of minutes to weeks. We study and apply selected mathematical methods and 
analysis techniques.  Students will be introduced to the requirements on a grid 
owner/operator, and the time-frames of activity that structure efforts to meet and maintain 
performance targets.  After completing this course, students will be prepared to analyze 
and evaluate the consequences for an electrical grid's physical and operational processes 
of connecting new equipment or adopting new communications and information systems. 
They will be familiar with the use of selected power system software tools.

Take care of yourself.  Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by 
eating well, exercising, avoiding abuse of drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and 
taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.  
 
All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are 
many helpful resources available on campus- but you must take the step of accessing 
them. In fact, an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. 
Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or 
feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. 
Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: 
(http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/  and each campus has its own student services officers 
who you can meet in person and obtain information.  Consider reaching out to a friend, 
faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can 
help.
