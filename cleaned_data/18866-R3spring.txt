Course Description: 
Over one billion people in the world still lack access to electricity, many of them out of 
reach of the electricity grid in the near term. This course will explore the technologies 
and architectures used to provide electricity services in off-grid regions of the developing 
world including mini/microgrids and solar home systems. Basic system design principles 
will be discussed and applied. Students will use HOMER modeling software to 
characterize the performance and economic viability of off-grid electricity systems. In 
addition to studying off-grid technologies, the course will also explore the context in 
which these systems are deployed, their role in enabling development, and policy 
challenges to implementation.

Letter grades will be assigned based on mastery of course concepts and performance 
relative to your peers. The following standard grading scale can be used as a guide, 
however percent score thresholds for letter grades may be shifted down at the discretion 
of the instructor. The scale will not be shifted up.

Five homework assignments will be assigned weekly, primarily from the course textbook 
but may also include short essays related to class discussions. There will be no homework 
assigned during the final two weeks of class to allow time to work on projects. 
 
HOMER Project 
A mini final project will involve the design of a hybrid off-grid electricity system using 
HOMER Pro software. Students will submit a project report and HOMER files. 
 
Final Exam 
There will be a comprehensive final exam.
