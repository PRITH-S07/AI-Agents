Course Description:
Data analytics is the process of analyzing datasets in order to draw conclusions, generate insights,
make predictions and support decision-making. This course will take a practical approach to
solving challenges in the public and private sectors using data analytics. A number of different
themes will be explored as case studies in order to demonstrate how data-driven decision-making
has widespread applications.
The course will examine how the question being posed, the
available data and the selected modelling approach all come together to arrive at a feasible
solution. A range of quantitative techniques, involving both linear and nonlinear methods will be
presented for dealing with numerical structured datasets. Substantial emphasis will be placed on
the process of delivering data analytics via a dashboard to facilitate decision-making and
policy-making. The course content will be structured to provide a roadmap for carrying out the
necessary procedures and will be illustrated using case studies, reading material and previously
published models. Participants will obtain hands-on experience by working on specific challenges
with real-world data through a carefully structured set of assignments.
Learning Objectives:
The objective of this course is to provide students with practical experience of undertaking a data
analytics project to address a challenge of their choice. This process involves: (1) proposing a
feasible research plan based on a challenge that can be addressed with available data; (2)
exploratory analysis of the data; (3) construction and evaluation of a quantitative model; and (4)
communication of the model output to decision-makers. This will involve identifying a relevant
key performance indicator and collecting appropriate explanatory variables. The ability to write a
report that documents the challenge, data, analysis, model, evaluation and feasibility of deploying
the analytics in a real-world setting will be assessed. Applications will include forecasting,
classification, novelty detection and risk monitoring.
Outcomes
After completing this course, students should be able to:
●
Design a data analytics project in response to a specific challenge
●
Download and organize data for addressing the challenge
●
Explore the dataset using visualization techniques
●
Apply a range of quantitative techniques
2

●
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different models
●
Select an approach that is optimal for meeting the objective
●
Present conclusions and recommendations
●
Communicate model output to decision-makers
Grading
The grades for this course will be based on students’ performance on three homework
assignments, Canvas quizzes, a final exam and class participation. Homework assignments will
be done individually and turned in via Canvas by the designated due date. Late work will be
acceptable until 24 hours past the deadline, but it will lose 10%. The assignments will be graded
based on both a writing report and code used to achieve results presented in the report. Class
participation will be evaluated based on the student's contribution to discussions both in-class and
on the Piazza Discussion Board. When posting or reacting to online discussion threads, students
are expected to use their own words and the post should be relevant to the topic under discussion.
Make sure to introduce, summarize and explain the article in your own words to enlighten the
audience on the point the article is making.

Deadlines:
It is expected that deadlines are respected and met on time. Missing a deadline by between 0 and
24 hours will result in the deduction of 10% of the marks assigned. A submission made later than
24 hours after the deadline, will be regarded as unclassified and result in zero marks. In the case
of a situation preventing a student from meeting the deadline (such as a medical condition), a
student is required to write to the professor and TAs of the course in advance, copy his/her
advisor and submit supporting evidence.
MATLAB:
One option is to use MATLAB software. Download MATLAB software for your computer
operating system from the CMU download website. After unzipping the file, read the
3

Matlab-Licence_Instructions.pdf file for instructions for connecting to MATLAB server and
running MATLAB.
Python
Another option is to use Python. Google Colaboratory (Colab) is an excellent platform for
building notebooks which allow you to combine executable code and rich text in a single
document, along with images, HTML, LaTeX.
When using Google Colab, it's important to deactivate AI assistance to avoid potential
issues related to high similarity with other students' work. Turn off any AI tools or
auto-suggest features in Colab to ensure your work remains original and is not flagged for
high similarity. This will help maintain the integrity of your work.
Canvas and Piazza:
Canvas will be used for posting supplementary course materials and turning in assignments.
Please familiarize yourself with navigating, uploading and downloading. Piazza will be used for
questions and discussion among students, TAs and the instructor.

Education Objectives (Relationship of Course to Program Outcomes)
The ECE department is accredited by ABET to ensure the quality of your education. 
ABET defines 7 Educational Objectives that are fulfilled by the sum total of all the
courses you take.  The following list describes which objectives are fulfilled by this
course and in what manner they are fulfilled. The objectives are numbered from “1”
through “7” in the standard ABET parlance. Those objectives not fulfilled by this course
have been omitted from the following list:
1) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by
applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics: The course
poses many problems in homework assignments involving data from complex
real-world systems that will require students to think critically, analyse, model
and solve using good engineering practice.
2) an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet
specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as
well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors: The
course introduces the use of analytics and machine learning to address specific
challenges
and
facilitate
improved
decision-making
for
practitioners
and
managers in public and private sectors.
3) an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences: Students can
practice communication skills remotely (Piazza Q&A), during class (quizzes,
polls, questions and answers) and especially during recitations where challenges
are discussed and volunteers with solutions are welcome to present.

relation to data sampling biases, model error, risk and uncertainty. Case studies
are used to demonstrate the potential adverse consequences of AI.
5) an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide
leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals,
plan tasks, and meet objectives: Quizzes and polls are used as a mechanism to
encourage group discussion and motivate debate about the process of interpreting
data and arriving at implementable solutions.
6) an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and

course focuses extensively on the interpretation and analysis of data to predict
outcomes and generate actionable insights based on transparent processes that can
be documented and explained.
7) an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate
learning strategies: Students will tackle problems using real-world datasets and
will select from amongst a range of techniques and models to undertake statistical
learning and arrive at a robust and predictive solution.
