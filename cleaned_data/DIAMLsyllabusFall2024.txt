Course Description:
This course will provide the methods and skills required for utilizing data and
quantitative models to automate predictive analytics and make improved decisions. From
descriptive statistics to data analysis to machine learning the course will demonstrate the
process of collecting, cleaning, interpreting, transforming, exploring, analyzing and
modeling data with the goal of extracting information, communicating insights and
supporting decision-making. The advantages and disadvantages of linear, nonlinear,
parametric, nonparametric and ensemble methods will be discussed while exploring the
challenges of both supervised and unsupervised learning. The importance of quantifying
uncertainty, statistical hypothesis testing and communicating confidence in model results
will be emphasized. The advantages of using visualization techniques to explore the data
and communicate the outcomes will be highlighted throughout. Applications will include
visualization, clustering, ranking, pattern recognition, anomaly detection, data mining,
classification, regression, forecasting and risk analysis. Participants will obtain hands-on
experience during project assignments that utilize publicly available datasets and address
practical challenges.
Learning Objectives:
The objective of this course is to provide students with an overview of the use and
potential of data analysis and machine learning in research, business and government. For
example, the task could be to seek an answer to a practical challenge, segment customers,
understand client behavior or formulate a new strategy for optimizing key performance
indicators (KPIs), by applying data analysis techniques to real-world datasets.
Participants will learn how to plan, design and implement an empirical research project
using statistical, computational and quantitative techniques. They will learn how to test
for statistically significant relationships, construct a variety of models, communicate the
outcomes from complicated analyses and build decision support tools. Practical skills will
be strengthened by discussing project design, data collection, data quality and techniques
to account for uncertainty and cope with measurement errors, missing values and outliers.
The course will combine theoretical aspects of data analysis with visual examples and
demonstrations of how to construct and utilize statistical models obtained from machine
learning approaches in practice. There will be a strong emphasis on highlighting the
challenges of working with real-world data, avoiding over-fitting and the risks of relying
on traditional assumptions.

Outcomes
After completing this course, students should be able to:
•
Design an empirical project in response to a specific objective
•
Identify and collect relevant data for undertaking the project
•
Acquire data and organize it into a structured format
•
Visualize data, identify key characteristics and present a summary
•
Describe the advantages and disadvantages of different models
•
Decide which models are likely to work best for a given application
•
Undertake feature construction and feature selection
•
Apply machine learning techniques for estimation and evaluation
•
Select an optimal model using statistical approaches
•
Produce diagnostic information for investigating model properties
•
Understand model weaknesses and where assumptions could fail
•
Communicate model output and conclusions to end-users
Grading
The grades for this course will be based on students’ performance on seven homework
assignments, a final exam and class participation. Homework assignments will be done
individually and turned in via Canvas by the deadline. Late work will be acceptable until
24 hours past the deadline, but it will lose 10%. The assignments will be graded based on
both a writing report and code used to achieve the results presented in the report. Class
participation will be evaluated based on the student's contribution to discussions both in
class and on the Piazza Discussion Board. When posting or reacting to online discussion
threads, students are expected to use their own words and the post should be relevant to
the topic under discussion. Make sure to introduce, summarize and explain the article in
your own words to enlighten the audience on the point the article is making.
