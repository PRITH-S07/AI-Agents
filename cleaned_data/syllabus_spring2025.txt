Course Description:  
The brain is among the most complex systems ever studied. Underlying the brain's ability 
to process sensory information and drive motor actions is a network of roughly 10^11 
neurons, each making 10^3 connections with other neurons. Modern statistical and 
machine learning tools are needed to interpret the plethora of neural data being collected, 
both for (1) furthering our understanding of how the brain works, and (2) designing 
biomedical devices that interface with the brain. This course will cover a range of 
statistical methods and their application to neural data analysis. The statistical topics 
include latent variable models, dynamical systems, point processes, dimensionality 
reduction, Bayesian inference, and spectral analysis. The neuroscience applications 
include neural decoding, firing rate estimation, neural system characterization, 
sensorimotor control, spike sorting, and field potential analysis. 
 
Course goals: 
There are two primary goals for the course: (1) to introduce the statistical tools used to 
study large-scale neural activity, and (2) to bring out the real-world challenges of 
working with experimental data. By the end of the course, students should be able to ask 
research-level questions in neural signal processing, as well as develop new statistical 
tools for problems in their own research. In short, this course serves as a stepping stone to 
research in neural signal processing. 

 
Number of Units:  
12 
 
Pre-requisites: 
This course is ideally suited for students with a solid background in basic probability and 
linear algebra. Prior knowledge of neuroscience is welcome, but not required. Students 
with experience in neuroscience should be aware that the first 2 weeks will cover basic 
neuroscience. 
 
Students should already be familiar with concepts such as: 
 
Probability -- independence, conditional probability, Bayes rule, multivariate Gaussian 
distribution, Poisson distribution 
 
Linear algebra -- basic matrix operations (sums and products), matrix inversion, 
eigenvectors and eigenvalues, singular value decomposition

Assignments and exams: 
There will be approximately 8 problem sets during the semester and regular reading 
assignments. There will be a midterm exam in class and a final exam during the week 
April 28 – May 5, dates TBD. 

 
Most problem sets will have a Matlab component, in which students will implement 
various algorithms and apply them to neural data. This link has information about how to 
obtain Matlab software: https://guides.library.cmu.edu/matlab. 
 
Students may discuss problem sets, but each student must turn in his/her own work. You 
may not simply copy another student's work. All students are bound by the CMU
